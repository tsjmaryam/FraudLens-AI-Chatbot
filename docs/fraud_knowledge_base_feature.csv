id,category,tags,text
1,feature_definition,"card_id,identifier","card_id is an internal identifier for the payment instrument; it is primarily used for entity linkage and historical aggregation, not a standalone risk signal."
2,feature_definition,"amount,transaction",Transaction amount represents the value of the purchase; unusual magnitude relative to an account's historical spending may prompt additional review depending on context.
3,feature_definition,"use_chip,terminal,entry",use_chip indicates whether EMV chip was used at POS; entry methods have different risk profiles and may inform review when combined with other factors.
4,feature_definition,"merchant_id,identifier","merchant_id uniquely identifies the merchant entity; it supports history-based analysis (e.g., dispute rates) but is not determinative by itself."
5,feature_definition,"merchant_state,geo",merchant_state refers to the merchant’s registered state; geographic consistency is evaluated relative to customer behavior and travel context.
6,feature_definition,"zip,geo",zip is the merchant postal code; it can support location consistency checks but should be interpreted with other geo/device signals.
7,feature_definition,"mcc,merchant_category",mcc (Merchant Category Code) denotes merchant type; certain categories show distinct dispute patterns and may warrant closer review in context.
8,feature_definition,"card_brand,network",card_brand/network can correlate with authorization flows and chargeback patterns; brand alone is not a conclusive risk indicator.
9,feature_definition,"card_type,product","card_type (e.g., debit/credit/prepaid) affects usage and authorization rules; interpret relative to account history and channel."
10,feature_definition,"expires,card_lifecycle",expires indicates card expiration timing; lifecycle proximity may influence behavior but is not a standalone risk factor.
11,feature_definition,"has_chip,card_capability",has_chip reflects EMV capability of the card; absence/presence influences terminal checks but does not imply fraud on its own.
12,feature_definition,"num_cards_issued,account,portfolio",num_cards_issued is the count of cards on the account; higher counts can be normal (household/business) and should be viewed with usage patterns.
13,feature_definition,"credit_limit,exposure,utilization",credit_limit represents available exposure; unusual utilization patterns may prompt review depending on historical behavior.
14,feature_definition,"acct_open_date,tenure",acct_open_date indicates when the account was opened; tenure differences can affect baseline behavior and review thresholds.
15,feature_definition,"year_pin_last_changed,auth_hygiene",year_pin_last_changed can indicate credential hygiene recency; stale credentials may combine with other factors to increase review likelihood.
16,feature_definition,"card_on_dark_web,compromise,intel","card_on_dark_web flags external intelligence suggesting potential credential compromise; it is supportive context, to be corroborated with activity signals."
17,feature_definition,"current_age,demographic,sensitive",current_age may correlate with usage patterns but is a sensitive attribute; it should not drive adverse decisions and is mainly used for governance/fairness checks.
18,feature_definition,"retirement_age,planning,sensitive",retirement_age is a planning/segmentation field; it should not be used directly for decisioning and is relevant primarily for analytics if permitted.
19,feature_definition,"birth_year,demographic,sensitive","birth_year is a sensitive attribute; avoid use in decision logic. If present, restrict to compliance/fairness auditing per policy."
20,feature_definition,"birth_month,demographic,sensitive",birth_month is a sensitive attribute; not intended for adverse decisions. Use only for aggregated analytics or governance where allowed.
21,feature_definition,"gender,demographic,sensitive",gender is a sensitive attribute; it must not be used to make adverse decisions. Limit to bias monitoring and QA under governance controls.
22,feature_definition,"latitude,geo",latitude is merchant geolocation (paired with longitude); geo deviations can be travel-related and require contextual interpretation.
23,feature_definition,"longitude,geo",longitude complements latitude for merchant location; use alongside device/IP and customer itinerary indicators.
24,feature_definition,"per_capita_income,area_context,sensitive",per_capita_income is area-level socioeconomic context; avoid inferring individual intent. Use cautiously per policy.
25,feature_definition,"yearly_income,capacity,sensitive",yearly_income relates to spending capacity; interpret only in context of historical behavior and approved policy constraints.
26,feature_definition,"total_debt,liabilities,sensitive","total_debt reflects liabilities; not a fraud label. If used, restrict to review prioritization policy and avoid standalone adverse decisions."
27,feature_definition,"credit_score,credit_risk,sensitive",credit_score measures credit risk rather than fraud risk; do not equate score with fraudulent behavior. Use only as permitted by policy.
28,feature_definition,"num_credit_cards,portfolio",num_credit_cards is the number of credit cards held; evaluate relative to spending dispersion and account history.
29,feature_definition,"merchant_type,merchant_category",merchant_type categorizes business activity; some types have higher dispute rates and may need additional review with supporting signals.
30,feature_definition,"target,label,flag",target is the internal training label used to approximate 'flagged for review'; it indicates routing to review and does not confirm fraud.
31,feature_definition,"transaction_hour,time,behavior",transaction_hour helps compare activity against typical user patterns; off-hours behavior may warrant review in context.
32,feature_definition,"transaction_dayofweek,time,behavior",transaction_dayofweek informs routine vs deviation; differences alone are not determinative without corroborating factors.
33,pattern,"velocity,multiple_small",Multiple small transactions within a short time window can indicate card testing behavior prior to a larger purchase; corroborate with device and location.
34,policy,"flag_vs_fraud,review_scope",'Flagged' means routed for review under internal rules; it does not imply confirmed fraud. Explanations should describe reasons for flagging only.
35,guidance,"explanation_style,analyst","When explaining a flagged case, cite the top contributing factors and connect them to known patterns or policies; avoid definitive fraud statements."
36,guidance,"evidence_checklist,analyst","Evidence checklist: amount bin vs baseline, merchant category, geo consistency, device/entry method (chip/magstripe), account tenure, recent declines."
37,policy,"sensitive_attributes,governance","Sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, age buckets) must not be used for adverse decisions unless explicitly permitted; limit to fairness analysis and QA."
